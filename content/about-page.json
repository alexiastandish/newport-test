Ltd. in Hyderabad, India to give us a work force that can scale so we can focus on specific areas of the non-patient facing aspects of Healthcare that demand volume, data driven processes and integrity. Instead of focusing on one aspect of the practice, our partnership brings expertise on multiple levels to ensure financial stability and promote growth. Utilizing technology and process efficiency as key resources, we are able to capture our clients’ revenue while minimizing their staffing overhead and other associated costs."
