        Practice Advocates Our growing Client Success team is the tip of the
        spear in our advocacy for your financial success. They bring a wealth of
        expertise to you. Their aim is your success within our systems and
        processes. This is where we start taking your current processes and keep
        them where they fit or refine them based on other specialty practices
        successes. They also provide continual feedback to your organization to
        continually improve our respective revenue. Operationally we advocate
        for your financial success by looking to reduce costs or increase
        revenue or in some cases, both at once. This again requires the constant
        analysis of data and feedback to your teams. Another aspect is coding to
        the highest documented level of service and appealing claims to their
        highest level of opportunity. The financial viability of your
        organization is what keeps your doors open, profitable and us employed.
        Innovation is an increasing need for you. Your specialty practice is
        unique in this need and the cookie cutter apps available to you are
        likely developed for the primary care physician (the mass). We dream big
        with you and have been successful with innovating apps to better meet
        the unique needs of our clientele. We love it when practices are willing
        to dream big with us and stay ahead of the market by anticipating
        change.
